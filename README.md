# TicTacToe

I created a str based Tic Tac Toe game. It simply looks for any combination of two player moves and an empty space indicating a win opportunity for the computer or a potential win for the player: -XX X-X XX- -OO 0-O OO-

The AUTO TicTacToe is made to create data for neural network training by playing itself and collecting that data.
